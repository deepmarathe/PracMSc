Practical 2a
Module 2:-Fuzzy Sets, Fuzzy Logic, Artificial Neural
Networks
Aim:-Create a simple rule-based system in Prolog for
diagnosing a common illness based on symptoms.
Theory:-
Prolog expressions are comprised of the following truth-functional
symbols, which have the same interpretation as in the predicate
calculus.
Code:-
%Facts:Define symptoms
symptom(fever).
symptom(cough).
symptom(sore_throat).
symptom(body_aches).
symptom(runny_nose).
symptom(headache).
symptom(fatigue).
%Facts:Define possible illnesses
condition(cold).
condition(flu).
condition(strep_throat).
%Rules: Diagnosing based on the presence of symptoms
diagnose(cold):-
symptom(runny_nose),
symptom(cough),
symptom(sore_throat),
\+ symptom(fever). %Absence of fever

diagnose(flu):-
symptom(fever),
symptom(cough),
symptom(body_aches),
symptom(headache),
symptom(fatigue).
diagnose(sterp_throat):-
symptom(sore_throat),
symptom(fever),
\+symptom(cough). %Absence of cough
%Alternative:Diagnosing based on rule covering all possible
symptoms
diagnose(unknown):-
\+diagnose(cold),
\+diagnose(flu),
\+diagnose(strep_throat).
%Quries: Example of how to diagnose
%?-diagnose(Condition).
%Output:Condition = flu.(if the symptoms match the flu criteria)
%Assuming the patient has the following symptoms:
symptom(fever).
symptom(cough).
symptom(body_aches).
symptom(headaches).
symptom(fatigue).
%You can ask Prolog:
?-diagnose(Condition).
