Aim:-Implement Conditional Probability and joint
probability using Python.
Theory:-
1. Joint Probability: Joint probability refers to the probability of two
events happening at the same time. It represents the likelihood of both
events occurring simultaneously. In probability theory, the joint
probability of two events (A) and (B) is denoted as ( P(A, B)).
For example, if you roll two dice, the joint probability of getting a 3
on the first die and a 4 on the second die would be the product of the
probabilities of getting a 3 on the first die and a 4 on the second die.
Mathematical Definition:
The joint probability of two events (A) and (B) occurring together is
defined as:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
If the two events are independent (i.e., one event does not affect the
other), the joint probability is the product of the probabilities of the
two events:
Conditional Probability:
In the case where events A and B are independent (where event A has
no effect on the probability of event B), the conditional probability of
event B given event A is simply the probability of event B, that is
P(B)
P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A)
2. Conditional Probability:
Conditional probability refers to the probability of an event occurring
given that another event has already occurred. It quantifies the
probability of one event happening under the assumption that another

event is true. It is denoted by ( P(A | B) ), which reads as "the
probability of ( A) given (B )."
Mathematical Definition: The conditional probability of event ( A )
given that event (B) has occurred is defined as:
Events A and B are independent(i.e., events whose probability of
occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities). if
P(A∩B)=P(A)⋅P(B)P(A∩B)=P(A)⋅P(B)
If A and B are not independent then they are dependent.
Conditional probability adjusts the probability of an event based on
new information. For example, if you already know that it is raining
(event ( B)), the probability of you carrying an umbrella (event (A))
may increase.
Example:
Suppose:
A single fair die is rolled. Let A={3}A={3} and B={1,3,5}B={1,3,5}.
Are A and B independent
Solution
In this example we can compute all three probabilities
P(A)=16P(A)=16, P(B)=12P(B)=12,
and P(A∩B)=P({3})=16P(A∩B)=P({3})=16. Since the
product P(A)⋅P(B)=(16)(12)=112P(A)⋅P(B)=(16)(12)=112 is not the
same number as P(A∩B)=16P(A∩B)=16, the events A and B are
not independent
Relationship Between Joint and Conditional Probability:
Joint and conditional probability are closely related through Bayes'
Theorem. You can rearrange the formula for conditional probability to
express the joint probability in terms of conditional probability:
The joint probability P(A∩B) can be expressed in terms of the
conditional probability: P(A∩B)=P(A∣B)⋅P(B)

This shows that the joint probability is the product of the
conditional probability of A given Band the probability of B.
Similarly, you could also express the joint probability as:
P(A∩B)=P(B∣A)⋅P(A)
In summary, joint probability is essentially the "unconditional"
version of the overlap between two events, while conditional
probability looks at how likely one event is given that the other has
already happened. These two concepts are tightly linked through the
formulas above.
The joint probability P(A∩B) represents the probability that it rains
and your friend carries an umbrella.
The conditional probability P(A∣B) represents the probability that it
rains, given that your friend carries an umbrella.
The relationship between them is P(A∩B)=P(A∣B)⋅P(B)
Both concepts are fundamental in understanding how events relate to
each other in probability theory and are used in various applications
such as decision-making, risk assessment, and machine learning.
Code:-
import pandas as pd
# Load the penguins dataset from a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('penguins.csv')
# Preview the data
print("Data Preview:")
print(df.head())
# Create a pivot table for joint probability

# Pivot table will be for Species (rows) and Island (columns), and
we'll compute frequencies
pivot_table = pd.crosstab(df['species'], df['island'], normalize=True)
print("\nJoint Probability (Pivot Table):")
print(pivot_table)
# Example: Conditional Probability of Species given Island
# We can normalize along columns to get conditional probabilities
conditional_probability = pivot_table.div(pivot_table.sum(axis=0),
axis=1)
print("\nConditional Probability of Species given Island:")
print(conditional_probability)
# To calculate Joint Probability, we already have it in the pivot table,
normalized=True gives joint probabilities
print("\nJoint Probability is represented in the pivot table (Species vs
Island):")
print(pivot_table)
# Example: Calculating P(Species = Adelie | Island = Biscoe)
p_adelie_given_biscoe = conditional_probability.loc['Adelie',
'Biscoe']
print(f"\nP(Adelie | Biscoe) = {p_adelie_given_biscoe:.4f}")
