Module 1:-Expert System its Applications, Probability theory
Aim:-Design an Expert system using AIML.
Theory:-
Design an Expert system using AIML E.g: An expert system for
responding the patient query for identifying the flu.
Concept: Artificial Intelligence Markup Language is referred to as
AIML. It was the Alicebot that created AIML. It's a community for
free software. Dr. Richard S. Wallace from 1995 to the present. An
application called a chat box is made with AIML. In order to create an
expert system using AIML, the following points should be taken into
account.
* In an expert system there are three main components: User Interface,
Inference Engine and Knowledge Base
User Interface: Uses various user interfaces, such as menus,
graphics, and dashboards, or Natural Language Processing (NLP) to
communicate with the user.
Expert System: A software program that makes decisions or provides
advice based on databases of expert knowledge in various contexts,
such as medical diagnosis. An expert system is a computer program
that solves problems in a specialized field that typically calls for
human expertise using techniques from artificial intelligence.
A well-organized collection of data about the system's domain is
called a knowledge base.
The knowledge base's facts are interpreted and assessed by the
inference engine, which then outputs the desired results or an answer.

* The expert system communicates with the user through a readable
user interface, receives queries as input, and outputs results.

 These symptoms could be associated with the flu. However, I
recommend visiting a healthcare professional for an accurate
diagnosis.

 Yes, flu is highly contagious and can spread easily from
person to person.

 <pattern>HOW CAN I PREVENT FLU<pattern>
 <template>
 The best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccine each
year. Additionally, wash your hands frequently, avoid close contact
with sick people, and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
